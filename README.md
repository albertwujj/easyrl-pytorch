# easyrl
Reinforcement learning algorithms in Pytorch. Thouroughly commented, clear implementations.
## Proximal Policy Optimization
An RL algorithm where the maximization objective for a state-action pair is the advantage times ratio of the probability over the old probability, clipped. 
Works in parallel with multiple envs
